This project utilizes logistic regression modeling to predict linear sets within the dataset.
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks,
where the goal is to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.
After implementing logistic regression, we aim to further improve the accuracy and precision of our predictions by incorporating k-means clustering.
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into distinct groups based on similarity.
By combining logistic regression with k-means clustering, we enhance our predictive model by identifying clusters of similar data points and incorporating this information into our classification process.
This approach helps us achieve a more refined and accurate prediction of linear sets within the dataset.
